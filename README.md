# Week 1 – Python Fundamentals  
## Data Science Internship Assignment

## 📌 Project Overview

This assignment was completed as part of my Data Science Internship program.  
The primary objective of Week 1 was to build a strong foundation in Python programming by creating a simple interactive console-based application.

The program collects user information such as name, age, hobby, and career goals, then displays a personalized welcome message using formatted output.

This task helped in understanding core programming concepts that are essential for data science development.


## Objectives

- Understand Python syntax and program structure
- Learn how to collect user input using `input()`
- Store and manage data using variables
- Use `print()` for structured output
- Apply f-strings for string formatting
- Develop a simple interactive Python application


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

##  Technical Details

### Concepts Implemented

- Variables
- User Input Handling
- String Formatting using f-strings
- Console Output Formatting
- Sequential Execution Flow

### Algorithm

1. Prompt the user for personal details:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Hobby
   - Dream Career
   - Additional details
2. Store responses in variables
3. Use formatted strings to generate a personalized message
4. Display structured output in the console

### Program Flow

The program follows a simple linear execution model:
- Input → Processing → Output

##  Testing Evidence

The application was tested using multiple sets of user inputs to ensure:

- Accurate data collection
- Proper variable handling
- Correct formatted output
- No runtime errors

Example Test Case:

Input:
- Name: Varsh
- Age: 21
- Hobby: Coding
- Dream Career: Data Scientist

Output:
- Personalized welcome message displayed correctly.
